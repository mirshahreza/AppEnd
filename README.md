# What is AppEnd?

AppEnd is a fullstack low-code environment. It helps you to create APIs, user interfaces and manage access levels, **Low Code** and Rapid Application Development (**RAD**) Environment.


## Why AppEnd?

As you know there are several RAD tools, so why should you use the AppEnd?  

- It is open source and freeware  
- Easy to use with a low learning curve  
- Really clean, simple and modular architecture  
- It can host on Linux & Windows  
- It is not just for Database IO, It is a platform to develop anything and a fullstack application host  
- The framework structure is developer friendly and is based on general development standards  
- You can easily inject your custom code in client and server components  
- User Interfaces and backends are fully customizable  
- User Interfaces are based on Bootstrap & VueJs (They are easy to learn and use)  
- User Interfaces are based on translation files so you can have applications in multiple languages  
- Easily inspect database structure and create applications based on it  
- You can manage and use APIs directly in other applications  
- Initial full stack CRUD scenarios can generate by some simple clicks :)  
- AppEnd can be a platform to develop back office and front office parts  
- BuiltIn module to manage deployment tasks  
- Can deploy single or multi node  
- It is under development and is a live project  

## Technology

Host: Linux Or Windows  

Application Server: .Net Core / C#  

Database: MsSql  

Client: SPA based made by Bootstrap & VueJs 3  


## Roadmap 

Database centric applications must to have at least below sections considering users access levels  

1- Application builder & CRUD functionalities: In progress  

- Make Tables and Lists responsive  
- New UI widgets : To make Create-Update forms better  
- More advanced searchbars for generated Lists  
- UI designer  
- Docker image : To easy installation  
- Package Manager : To create/import/export packages as portable plugins  
- Git : To manage your production  
- OpenId (SSO)  
- Task Scheduler  
    
2- Workflow Engine: Planning  

3- Repotting and Visualization system: Planning  

So we will dive into phase 2 and 3 after phase 1 becomes stable enough.


## Getting Started Guide
### To run the project  

1. Clone the repository

2. Open it by Visual Studio 2022  

3. Setup MSSQL Server database, to setup database  

3.1 Create an empty database in your sql server instance

3.2 Get the [Zzz_Deploy](https://github.com/mirshahreza/RDBMS-PackageManager/blob/master/MsSql/Zzz_Deploy.sql) producer (please go to the webapge and then download the file)

3.3 Add the above producer to the database  

3.3.1 in "SQL Server Management Studi" go to FIle -> Open -> file and select the **Zzz_Deploy.sql** file then click on **EXCUTE** 

3.3.2 Right click at your new created Database at step 3-1 then select **New Query** 

3.4 Running the following commands in "SQL Server Management Studio" to Initiate your database on blank query window after that click on **EXCUTE**, now you must see the Tables and Views on your new database:

     EXEC Zzz_Deploy
     EXEC Zzz_Deploy 'AppEnd'  
     

4. Change the database connection string at the 'AppEnd\AppEndHost\appsettings.json'

5. Run the 'AppEndHost'Â project (Default Username is Admin and Password is P#ssw0rd)
